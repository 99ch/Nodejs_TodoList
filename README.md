## 📝 To-Do List Application in Node.js  

This web application allows users to create and manage a task list intuitively. The interface includes:  
- A form to add new tasks.  
- A list displaying all recorded tasks.  
- Options to mark tasks as completed or delete them.  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
The application is built using several technologies to ensure smooth functionality:  
- **Node.js**: Handles server-side logic.  
- **Express.js**: Creates routes for user interaction via a web browser.  
- **EJS**: Generates dynamic views to display tasks and the input form.  
- **CSS**: Styles the interface for a better user experience.  
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Stores and manages tasks in a database.  
- **Nodemon**: Monitors code changes and automatically restarts the server for easier development.  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. When a user adds a task via the form, **Node.js** and **Express.js** handle the request and store it in the database using **Mongoose**.  
2. The task list is retrieved and displayed dynamically with **EJS**.  
3. Users can mark tasks as completed or delete them, updating the database in real time.  

By combining these technologies, the application offers a smooth and user-friendly task management experience.  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **Create, Update, and Delete Tasks**:  
   - Add new tasks.  
   - Update tasks (edit details, mark as completed).  
   - Delete tasks that are no longer needed.  

✅ **Task Categorization**:  
   - Organize tasks into different categories (work, personal, shopping, etc.).  
   - Add labels/tags for better filtering and organization.  

✅ **MongoDB for Data Storage** to keep tasks persistent.
